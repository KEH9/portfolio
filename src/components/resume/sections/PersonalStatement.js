            I am inquisitive and like to learn something new. I have a certain portion
            of perfectionism and prefer a systematical approach to job and studies.
            I enjoying to solve complex problems and to find non-standard solutions.
            I like to create convenient products which are shows respect to time
            and resources of the users. Easily making contacts with people, some of my
            ex-colleagues are still my close friends. I prefer not to work for intermediaries.
